Computer emulator written in and running LuaJIT

Specs:
- Custom FS implementation
- Low-level I/O channel based system communication
- Classic 80x43 IBM VGA (size 8x14) emulated terminal

Launch via `launchKinesis.vbs`

The goal is for this to be cross-platform, but I would like to get it running first. So currently, only windows is guaranteed support.

The EEPROM (eeprom.lua) comes pre-packaged with kBoot, and currently KinesisOS is installed. You are completely free to wipe both or just KinesisOS and write your own.

Docs soon, I promise
