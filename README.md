# Kinesis

LuaJIT low-level computer emulator

The goal is for this to be cross-platform, but I would like to get it running first. So currently, only windows is guaranteed support.

The EEPROM (eeprom.lua) comes pre-packaged with kBoot, and currently KinesisOS is installed. You are completely free to wipe both or just KinesisOS and write your own.
